### Installation
For this to work as intended *(without having to edit the menu paths)*, you will need to download this repo and extract the `Tools` folder into the root of your system drive. `C:\`. Once done you can choose to use the included subfolders for each supported program as the root folders for them, or edit the `set INSTALL_DIR=` string in the `.cmd` files located inside the `Scripts` sub directory.

**Note**: Do NOT edit anything in the `Scripts\res` subdirectory unless you know what you are doing. That is reserved for command functions that require a seperate batch file and will break if modified.

The included program subfolders include shortcuts to the downloads for each program that this menu supports.
