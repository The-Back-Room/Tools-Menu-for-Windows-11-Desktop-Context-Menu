<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>For this to work as intended <em>(without having to edit the menu paths)</em>, you will need to download this repo and extract the <code>Tools</code> folder into the root of your system drive. <code>C:\</code>. Once done you can choose to use the included subfolders for each supported program as the root folders for them, or edit the <code>set INSTALL_DIR=</code> string in the <code>.cmd</code> files located inside the <code>Scripts</code> sub directory.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Do NOT edit anything in the <code>Scripts\res</code> subdirectory unless you know what you are doing. That is reserved for command functions that require a seperate batch file and will break if modified.</p>
<p>The included program subfolders include shortcuts to the downloads for each program that this menu supports.</p>
