# Tools Menu for Windows 11 Desktop Context Menu
This menu grants quick use of some useful tools for desktop customizers.

## Supported Tools
Here is a list of currently supported tools. *(This list is NOT final. More tools will be added over time.)*

- DWMBlurGlass Menu
- ExplorerBlurMica Menu
- BasicThemer2 Menu
- Restart Explorer
- Restart Explorer7
- Refresh Icon Cache

## Planned Tools
Here is a short list of planned tools that currently are NOT supported. *(This is not final, This list can and wil be updated if I come across more tools that would fit the purpose of this menu.)*

- Proper menu icons for each tool and/or program
- OpenGlass Menu
- Classic Personlization Menu
- Mica for Everyone Menu

### Installation
For this to work as intended *(without having to edit the menu paths)*, you will need to download this repo and extract the `Tools` folder into the root of your system drive. `C:\`. Once done you can choose to use the included subfolders for each supported program as the root folders for them, or edit the `set INSTALL_DIR=` string in the `.cmd` files located inside the `Scripts` sub directory.

**Note**: Do NOT edit anything in the `Scripts\res` subdirectory unless you know what you are doing. That is reserved for command functions that require a seperate batch file and will break if modified.

The included program subfolders include shortcuts to the downloads for each program that this menu supports.
